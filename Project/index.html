          Welcome to my website! And thank you for taking a few moments to explore it.
          I'm using this webpage to display just a few of my technical proficiencies along with some personal life details,
          which you'll see as you journey through it.
          
          <br/>

          My website includes five different pages which you can navigate through using the menu bar at the top.
          You're currently on the Homepage, which includes four main sections.
          This is the Welcome section, which includes a short description of what this website is about and one of my favorite Spotify playlists.
          Next is an About section that describes who I am, and a picture of me.
          This is followed by a Professional section, which offers a snapshot of my current skill set and future career goals.
          Finally, the homepage is concluded with a Projects section which has at least one of my school projects and a personal project.

      My name is Charity Holmes and I'm currently a junior at Indiana University in Bloomington, studying Informatics with a cognate in Computer Science.
      I'm originally from Miami, Florida, so I am a transfer student.
      I transferred from Miami Dade College where my major was actually Enviormental Science. I made the switch onver to
      Informatics and tech once my love for the subject sparked from seemingly nowehere after I took the introductory course.

    <br />
    <br />

      I'm motivated by my desire to attain stability for myself and my loved ones.
      I also would love to give back to my community after I've reached a high level of finanial stability.
      I want to continue to foster within myself, an ever increasing sense of empathy as I am constantly
      exposed to the needs of others. Giving back will reinforce gratitude by reminding me that there is
      a world bigger than myself, and it will hold me accountable to all that I am capable of contributing.
      I am heavily motivated by the chance to give back to a community that has provided me with so much.

        <p>
          Please take the time watch to hear more about my proficiencies.
          It's a bit outdated by one semester, seeing as I'm no longer a Computer Science major or a sophomore.
          However, I hope to have an updated one soon that I can practice and post here!

      <h2 class="instagram">My Chosen People</h2> 
        <p>
          As mentioned in the above elevator pitch, I had the pleasure of working with two other members of the National Society of Black Engineers to assist
          with building a website for My Chosen People, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping battered women.

        <b> Project Description: </b> Poorly written poetry by yours truly!
        This isn't necesarily a project, rather just a fun pasttime. I like to dramatise some of my life experiences with poetry.
        Most of them are a little pretentious and somewhat cringe but I always feel a lot better after writing them. This is the reason why I quoted Jane Austen's 
        Pride and Prejudice in the book description. She expresses that while most everything will nourish what's already a strong feeling, a good sonnet
        or in my case a regular degular poem can starve away a "slight, thin sort of inclination" entirely, and I've found this to be very true.
