          I've recently been elected as a Co-Director of Diversity Equity & Inclusion for the IU Volunteer
          Corps board. Since volunteering and service is becoming a large part of my life I thought
          it would be great to highlight a few great non-profit organizations here in Bloomington.
          Please consider offering your support as I know it would be greatly appreciated.
